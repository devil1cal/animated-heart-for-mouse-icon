  <p>Hi there, I'm self-taught junior front-end developer. This is my own code, I will change and fix many issues in time. I created this with css-keyframe feature. It is fun and easy to use. You can see my code on <a href="https://codepen.io/devil1cal/full/KKPvZwz">Code Pen</a> too. I'm still learning important componants about the language, espacially CSS. </p>
